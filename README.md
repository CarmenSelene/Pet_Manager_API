# Pet_Manager_API
Pet Manager uses Loopback-API and MongoDB to create a simple pet registration system. The html front-end uses JQuery and vanilla Javascript along with AXIOS to manage the data. Currently can /post and /get with more functionality being added soon including results search/filtering and multiple pet types, drop down options for UI etc.
